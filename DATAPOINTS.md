# Datapoints to add to the game

The empty columns may be subject to change over the course of development.

[//]: # (TODO: implement sickness. Datapoints basically rely on that afterwards.)

| Datapoint                                                        | Description                                                                                                                   | Event                 | Sample Payload     | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Timepoint: wearing/removing goggles                              | The time point where the player took on/took off the goggles                                                                  | goggles_status_change | `{'put_on': true}` | What is needed is when the goggles were taken on or off. Since the game round and timer are both saved regardless of the event, they don't need to be stored in the payload.                                                                                                     |
| Timepoint: taking the bath                                       | The time point where the player took the bath                                                                                 | bath_taken            | `{}`               | Since the most important thing is _when_ the bath was taken, and both the round number and the timer are saved regardless of the event. Thus, the payload is empty. It is worth noting that this event can only be sent during the first three minutes of a given round, though. |
| Switching to the outgroup                                        | The moment where the player switches to the outgroup                                                                          | outgroup_switch       | `{}`               | The main thing one might need when looking at this event is when the switching happened. Since both the round number and the timer are saved for every event sent to the server, payload is empty.                                                                               |
| Interaction with signpost                                        | Event sent when the player interacts with a sign                                                                              |                       |                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Player gets sick                                                 | Event sent when the player gets sick                                                                                          | sickness              | `{'severe': true}` | Same comment as first three new datapoints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Character was “adherent” or “non-adherent” in the past 5 minutes | Took the bath during the first three minutes (bath adherence), or wore goggles for at least 4mns out of the past five minutes |                       |                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
